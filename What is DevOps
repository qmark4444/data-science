[0] create feature/stories/subtasks in sprint JIRA
[1] dev in local (may contain special dependencies)
[2] build = bundle, packaging, minify, (bundle dependencies/libraries)
    e.g JS build tools like Webpack, Grunt, Babel, Bower, npm, ...
    Java build tools like Maven
    Cloud Computing, Azure Pipeline, integrate different build tools
[3] push to Git branch (source control repo)
[4] deploy release to environment 

Actually what I have done with Heroku is a DevOps process
